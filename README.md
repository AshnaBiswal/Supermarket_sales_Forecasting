## What is sales forecasting?

Sales forecasting is the process of estimating future sales with the goal of better informing your decisions. A forecast is typically based on any combination of past sales data, industry benchmarks, or economic trends. It’s a method designed to help you better manage your workforce, ash flow, and any other resources that may affect revenue and sales

It’s typically easier for established businesses to create more accurate sales forecasts based on previous sales data. Newer businesses, on the other hand, will have to rely on market research, competitive benchmarks, and other forms of interest to establish a baseline for sales numbers. 

## Why is sales forecasting important?

Sales forecast is the foundation of the financial story for any business. Once a business's sales forecast completes, it will be able to easily create your profit and loss statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet.

### Sales forecast helps to answer all of these questions and potentially any others that involve the future of the business.

What do you hope to achieve in the next month? Year? 5-years? 
How many customers do you hope to have next month and next year?
How much will each customer hopefully spend with your company?
